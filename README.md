## What's with the name?

Here at ActionSprout, we like to name our services and apps after native Pacific Northwest plants. (Sprout? Geddit?) When we needed custom tools like this, it seemed only fitting that we'd use botanical tool names to do so.

The hori hori is a Japanese gardening knife, named for the onomatopoeia for "dig". In English, we should really call it a "dig dig"!
